	<key>cgi.check_shebang_line</key>
	<dict>
		<key>description</key>
		<string>Controls whether CGI PHP checks for line starting with #! (shebang) at the top of the running script. This line might be needed if the script support running both as stand-alone script and via PHP CGI. PHP in CGI mode skips this line and ignores its content if this directive is turned on.</string>

	<key>cgi.fix_pathinfo</key>
	<dict>
		<key>description</key>
		<string>Provides real PATH_INFO/ PATH_TRANSLATED support for CGI. PHP&apos;s previous behaviour was to set PATH_TRANSLATED to SCRIPT_FILENAME, and to not grok what PATH_INFO is. For more information on PATH_INFO, see the CGI specs. Setting this to 1 will cause PHP CGI to fix its paths to conform to the spec. A setting of zero causes PHP to behave as before. It is turned on by default. You should fix your scripts to use SCRIPT_FILENAME rather than PATH_TRANSLATED.</string>

	<key>cgi.force_redirect</key>
	<dict>
		<key>description</key>
		<string>cgi.force_redirect is necessary to provide security running PHP as a CGI under most web servers. Left undefined, PHP turns this on by default. You can turn it off at your own risk.</string>
		<key>default</key>
		<true/>

	<key>cgi.redirect_status_env</key>
	<dict>
		<key>description</key>
		<string>If cgi.force_redirect is turned on, and you are not running under Apache or Netscape (iPlanet) web servers, you may need to set an environment variable name that PHP will look for to know it is OK to continue execution.</string>
		<key>default</key>
		<string></string>

	<key>cgi.rfc2616_headers</key>
	<dict>
		<key>description</key>
		<string>Tells PHP what type of headers to use when sending HTTP response code. If it&apos;s set 0, PHP sends a Status: header that is supported by Apache and other web servers. When this option is set to 1, PHP will send Â» RFC 2616 compliant headers. Leave it set to 0 unless you know what you&apos;re doing.</string>
